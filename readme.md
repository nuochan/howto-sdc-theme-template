When you finish editing, save it the same way you [add the theme to your computer](#add-theme-to-your-computer), don't forget
to use the same name when you save the theme so that you can find it later.

If you wish to share the new theme or store it in Teams folder, upload the **.potx** file to SDC's Teams folder.

### Editing Sprint Review template

To edit SDC Sprint Review template, open the ***.potx*** file in PowerPoint app, make your changes and save the file. Make sure
you select  to save the file as a template instead of a slide deck. 

![](image/save_template.png)

with others or to save it for future use, make sure you upload the new template file to Teams folder. You can find the theme file

## Troubleshooting
### Can't edit in a browser

![](image/cant_edit_in_browser.png)
If you try editing in a browser but saw this message and are prevented to make changes in the browser, make sure you are not opening a template file directly. 
You can tell by looking at the suffix of the file. If the file name ends with ***.potx***, you have opened the PowerPoint template file.

Solution: Click **Viewing** and select **Open in Desktop App**.

![](image/open_in_app.png)

It will open the PowerPoint app in your computer and enable editing. It is recommended to save a copy before you make any changes further at this point.
To do so, go to **File** and select **Save a Copy**. You should not see other save options.

![](image/save_a_copy.png)

Make sure to select ***.pptx*** (or ***.ppt*** for older verions) in the dropdown menu

![](image/save_as_pptx.png)

If you have not save a copy before making any changes, you still have to save a copy once you have finished editing.

Once you have saved your slide deck as a ***.pptx*** file, you can upload the file to Teams and edit it in your browser.
